The elusive and unpredictable nature of financial markets has long been a source of intrigue and fascination for academic researchers and professional investors. With the high stakes for successful predictions, predictive analysis has emerged as a critical player in the decision-making processes of the finance industry. In this report, we examine the effectiveness of candlestick patterns and price action trading strategies in the context of the Indian equities market. Through developing and testing three distinct hypotheses, we aim to provide a nuanced and insightful examination of these techniques and contribute to the ongoing discourse on financial predictions. We suggest the following three hypotheses based on candlestick patterns and price action. In Hypothesis 1, we use the doji candlestick and some quantitative methods to predict trends in the market. In the 2nd hypothesis, we use the mean reversion technique augmented by Engulfing and Harami candles to forecast price movement. The 3rd hypothesis utilises a breakout strategy based on identifying uptrends using higher highs and higher lows.
